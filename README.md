## BirthdayCard

A basic one-page android app, using Android Studio and Kotlin.

The user will input a name and an age, and then press 'submit'.
A birthday greeting will then appear, with the inputted name and age included in the greeting.

If the user presses 'submit' without both fields completed, an error message will appear instead.
